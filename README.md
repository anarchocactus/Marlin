# Fork for FLSUN Q5 (stock)

NOTE and DISCLAIMER: This is a fork just for maintaining configurations. There will most certainly never be any code changes. USE THIS CONFIGURATION AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Reasons for going with Marlin

* The original firmware appears to be some kind of hacked Repetier. Hacked because Repetier officially does not support the MKS Robin Nano boards. It even appears not to be up to date
* I like to be in control of some aspects. The original firmware is closed-source. The only configuration is possible with a txt-file giving restricted possibilities for customization
* All the benefits of having a great community that permanently fixes bugs
* the communication with Octoprint gvies me frequent timeouts with loss of communication even at conservative 115200 Baud
* The LCD Menu lacks options I like from Marlin. While using GCODE in terminal is possible it sometimes is pretty cumbersome


## Description

This configuration is based on Q5_nano_v1 taken from the example configurations. If you want to start off from the beginning, keep in mind to use the corresponding branches otherwise your build will fail in the best case or behave strangely. So if you use the bugfix branch for Marlin also use the bugfix branch for the configurations.

I did some minor configuration tweaks to get the touch screen going. I went for the Classic UI, as the color UI is nice but somehow not reliable to use on the Q5's small touch screen.

There are also custom E-Steps and maybe some other specifics that may not apply to your printer. So please carefully review and understand the settings to avoid damage. If in doubt make a diff against the example configuration mentioned above. As for now there should be no problems when using this configuration as-is. But always mind the disclaimer!

### Calibration

Calibration is something FLSUN has not provided for in their LCD menu. For the "normal" user they rather appear to rely on the values that are manually configurable in the robin_nano_config file or even hard-coded defaults in the firmware. The first steps instructions do not trigger calibration but rather auto-leveling. This a difference and can be easily confused, as it happened to me as I had no experience with Delta printers before.

While the calibration can be triggered by the corresponding menu item the neccessary adjustment of the probe offset is a very manual process. To the rescue comes the Probe Offset Wizard that can be enabled. The calibration process would then roughly resemble the one in the original firmware.
There is however one major problem: When using the Wizard it does not disable soft endstops so you cannot adjust z below zero. I have filed a bug for it (https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/20848)

But there is a workaround by manually setting M211 S0 and/or by enabling a corresponing menu item in the firmware und using that for triggering soft endstops. Be careful what you do as there is good chance to crash the nozzle into the bed by accident when using the touch screen! Also note NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET setting in configuration.h. Default is -18 and should be save for a stock printer. -19.75 reduces the distance between nozzle and bed. This is the setting that must be ajusted after auto calibration.

The entire calibration now works as follows (at least for me):

1. Start the calibration process (config/delta calibration/auto calibration) with the probe mounted. This takes pretty long as Marlin goes through up to seven iterations when doing it for the first time
2. When finished, store settings
3. Disable soft endstops
4. Start the Probe Offset Wizard (advanced settings) still with the probe mounted
5. Remove the probe after z reference probing (be careful not to move the print head)
6. Dial in the probe z offset using paper or feeler gauge or something
7. When finished, store settings
8. Enable soft endstops
9. The new probe z offset should be now visible in both the configuration and advanced settings/probe offset

To double check, Home axis and then move z to zero. If the distance is incorrect manually adjust probe offset by small amounts and recheck.

### Auto Bed Leveling with Bilinear or UBL

First tests show that bilinear leveling is working well but UBL does not. I will need to work a bit more on this

### PID Tuning (Extruder)

With stock settings I could not get a stable temperature on the nozzle. It was over- and undershooting by about 5 to 10&deg;C even after numerous attempts of PID tuning. This is also the case with the original firmware. I did experiments with some values of PID_FUNCTIONAL_RANGE but larger values than the default of 10 only gave me more over-/undershoot apparently due to integral windup as explained here: https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?4,369867

After some more research and experiments I ended up with lowering PID_MAX (BANG_MAX) from 255 to 150 follwed by PID tuning. This prevents the nozzle from heating up too fast. The overshoot has vanished only leaving a small amount of undershoot at the beginning at the cost of some increased heating time. This is still not what I experienced with my Ender 3 Pro which has a much uncomplicated PID behaviour.

BTW: I have also measured the resistance of the heating cartridge to be sure to have a 24V version installed. Some folks reported the same problem because of using a 12V version in a 24V system. The resistance is around 15 Ohms. This is well within the bounds of a 24V/40W heating cartridge.

### Known problems

* I noticed that the touch screen freezes when using "Restore Defaults" or sending GCODE M502. I filed a bug for that as well: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/20849
* There are some minor GUI glitches like cut-off strings and wild pixels when moving axis but nothing dramatical

## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
